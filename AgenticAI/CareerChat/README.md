# CareerChat

An intelligent AI-powered career chat application that simulates conversations with a professional persona based on a resume. The application uses advanced AI models to provide realistic responses while maintaining quality through an automated evaluation and feedback system.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: Interactive chat interface built with Gradio
- **Resume-Based Persona**: AI agent that responds as a specific professional based on provided resume
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated evaluation system using Google's Gemini model to ensure response quality
- **Multi-Language Support**: Responds in the same language as the user's question
- **Self-Improvement**: Automatic retry mechanism when responses are rejected by the evaluator

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12+**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Primary AI model for generating responses
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Evaluation model for quality assessment
- **Gradio**: Web interface framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and parsing
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## Project Structure

├── app.py              # Main application with chat interface and AI logic
├── main.py             # Entry point (placeholder)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Google API key (for Gemini)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the CareerChat directory:

   ```bash
   cd AgenticAI/CareerChat
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your API keys:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:7860`)

## How It Works

### 1. Persona Creation

The application reads the resume from `resume.txt` and creates a system prompt that instructs the AI to respond as the professional described in the resume.

### 2. Chat Interface

Users can interact with the AI through a Gradio chat interface. The AI responds based on the resume information while following specific rules:

- Answer in the same language as the question
- Be polite and friendly
- Don't speak like an assistant
- Don't ask questions deliberately
- Admit when you don't know something

### 3. Quality Evaluation

Each response is automatically evaluated by a separate AI model (Gemini) that:

- Checks if the response follows the established rules
- Ensures the response is appropriate and helpful
- Provides feedback for improvement if needed

### 4. Self-Improvement

If a response is rejected by the evaluator, the system:

- Incorporates the feedback into an updated system prompt
- Regenerates the response with the improved context
- Ensures higher quality responses over time

## Configuration

### Customizing the Persona

To change the professional persona, simply replace the content in `resume.txt` with the desired resume information. The AI will automatically adapt to the new persona.

### Modifying Rules

The conversation rules can be modified in the `rules` variable in `app.py`:

```python
rules = """
- Answer in the same language as the question.
- Be polite and friendly.
- Do not speak like an assistant.
- Do not ask questions deliberately.
- If you don't know the answer, say so.
"""
```
